Submission info:
This assignment was due: 1/30/2017. I used a slip day and turned it in 1/31/2017.

Files included:
lab1.h
  - header file
  - states all the includes needed for the lab1a program
  - declares all the functions used in lab1.c 
lab1.c
  - implementation file for this submission.
  - default make target compiles this and links the pthread library
README
  - This file - an overview of the submission
Makefile
  - Makefile has three targets: lab1 (default), clean, and dist.
    - lab1, the default target, builds the executable (lab1a)
    - clean removes generated files: the lab1a executable and the tarball.
    - dist builds the tarball

About this submission:
This submission meets all the specifications listed in the assignment (to the best of my understanding) except for the following:
  - I believe there is a bug with my CR LF processing.
    - Without the --shell option, it works correctly.
    - With the --shell option, my program does not reset the cursor to the beginning of the line WHEN PROGRAMS RUN IN THE SHELL PRINT TO STDERR.
    - In my function "writeback(char *buff, int nBytes)" I try to explicitly recieve either CR or LF and write CRLF.
    - When the output of a shell program prints, the CRLF seems to work correctly - it's only in runtime errors that this bug appears.
    - TRY ISSUING A NONEXISTANT COMMAND IN --shell MODE TO SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT

  - I don't think my handling of ctrl-C is correct. When I send the SIGINT to the shell, the shell quits, which I don't think it should.
